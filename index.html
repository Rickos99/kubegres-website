                    <p><b>Kubegres</b> is a Kubernetes operator allowing to deploy a cluster of PostgreSql instances with data
                        replication enabled out-of-the box. It brings simplicity when using PostgreSql considering how
                        complex managing stateful-set's life-cycle and data replication could be with Kubernetes.</p>
                    <p>Kubegres has the following features:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                It creates a cluster of PostgreSql servers with data replication enabled: it creates a
                                Primary PostgreSql pod and a number of Replica PostgreSql pods and replicates primary's
                                database in real-time to Replica pods.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It manages fail-over: if a Primary PostgreSql crashes, it automatically promotes a Replica
                                PostgreSql as a Primary.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It has a data backup option allowing to dump PostgreSql data regularly in a given volume.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It provides a very simple YAML with properties specialised for PostgreSql.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It is resilient, has over

                                and has been running in production.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It works with the official <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres">
